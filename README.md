# ⚡ Comfy Connect Gateway

Create a cluster of your [ComfyUI Connect](https://github.com/Good-Dream-Studio/ComfyUI-Connect) instances.

> **WIP Warning** heavy development and not fully battle-tested, this package may contain bugs, please do not use in production for now.

**Key features :**
- **🎚️ Unchanged API** - The API stays the same with calls like POST `/api/connect/workflows/*`
- **🔌 Works behind NAT** - Your ComfyUI instances don't need to be directly accessible with IP, they connects directly to the gateway using websocket.
- **🚀 Dashboard** - Follow the load of your ComfyUI instances in the integrated dashboard
