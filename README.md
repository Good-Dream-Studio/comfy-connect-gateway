# âš¡ Comfy Connect Gateway

Create a cluster of your [ComfyUI Connect](https://github.com/Good-Dream-Studio/ComfyUI-Connect) instances.

> **WIP Warning** heavy development and not fully battle-tested, this package may contain bugs, please do not use in production for now.

**Key features :**
- **âœ¨ Plug and play** - Simply call the `POST /api/connect/workflows/*` endpoint of the gateway instead of your [ComfyUI Connect](https://github.com/Good-Dream-Studio/ComfyUI-Connect)
- **ðŸ”Œ Works behind NAT** - Your ComfyUI instances don't need to be directly accessible with IP, they connects directly to the gateway using websocket.
- **ðŸš€ Dashboard** - Follow the load of your ComfyUI instances in the integrated dashboard
- **ðŸ“ˆ Prometeus Metrics** - Connect your prometeus to `/metrics` and gather load metrics

## Usage as a package

You can use the ComfyUI Connect Gateway as a package in your own Node.js project:

```javascript
// Using CommonJS
const { Gateway } = require('comfyui-connect-gateway');

// Using ES Modules
import { Gateway } from 'comfyui-connect-gateway';

// Create a gateway with configuration options
const gateway = new Gateway({
  port: 8189,
  metricsInterval: 10000, // Update metrics every 10 seconds
  script: {} // Custom script configuration
});

// Start the gateway
gateway.start();

// Access the underlying components if needed
const cluster = gateway.getCluster();
const queue = gateway.getQueue();
const dispatcher = gateway.getDispatcher();

// Later, when you want to stop the gateway
gateway.stop();
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | number | 8189 | The port on which the gateway server will listen |
| `metricsInterval` | number | 5000 | Interval in milliseconds for updating metrics |
| `script` | object | `{}` | Custom script configuration |

## Available Scripts

The package includes the following scripts that you can run:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript |
| `npm run prepublishOnly` | Runs the build script before publishing |
| `npm run start` | Starts the Comfy Connect Gateway |
| `npm run dev` | Runs the gateway in development mode with auto-reload |
| `npm run test` | Placeholder for tests |

## Auto Scaler

The gateway includes an Auto Scaler feature that can dynamically adjust the number of ComfyUI instances based on workload.

### Auto Scaler Features

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically scales instances up or down based on queue size
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set your preferred queue-to-instance ratios
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevents rapid scaling up and down
- **Min/Max Constraints**: Set boundaries for scaling operations
